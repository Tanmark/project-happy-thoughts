# Happy Thoughts
This project consist of building a twitter like app that display (only) happy thoughts. The page displays a form where anyone can 
add a happy thought, like a happy thought with a heartshaped like button and read the 20 latest happy thoughts


## The problem
I started by trying to understande the different parts needed in this project. I created different components, one for the send message and one for the 
message that was going to be inputed and showed.
I struggled a bit with understanding what goes where. UseEffect was a bit hard to understand exactly, for now I am happy to know where to 
place it when needed, but I look forward to understand it better.
To solve problems - a lot of help with eslint and other error msg in our slack channel. Google is my friend.
